TypeQuux
========

Typelevel programming allows developers to encode several flavours of runtime invariants into the type system. 
Unfortunately, libraries that support typelevel programming tend to be poorly documented, difficult to understand and 
difficult to hack. 

This makes them hard to customize to the needs of a specific project/problem. TypeQuux provides concise, 
efficient and easy-to-modify implementations of several typelevel programming primitives. As such, it represents 
collected wisdom on type-hackery in scala.

You can now:

* Head over to the [github page](https://github.com/harshad-deo/typequux) which has instructions on how to set-up a project
* Peruse through the [API](https://harshad-deo.github.io/typequux/api/typequux/index.html)
* Read the examples below

Happy Hacking!
